# Additional Mazes

This file contains additional mazes you can use for testing on a smaller scale so your program runs faster.

It also includes invalid mazes so that you can validate that your program works for testing if mazes are valid or not.

## Smaller Mazes

```python
maze = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

start = (1, 1)
goal = (1, 3)
```

```python
maze = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

start = (1, 1)
goal = (5, 1)
```

## Unsolvable Mazes

```python
maze = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

start = (1, 1)
goal = (1, 3)
```

```python
maze = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

start = (1, 1)
goal = (1, 5)
